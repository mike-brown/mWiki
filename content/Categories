Categories
==========

Categories are used to group similar pages together. Categories can belong to other categories,
giving a hierachical structure. Categories can also have their own content, such as shown on the
[Categories][1] category page.

Defining a category
-------------------

Categories are content files that are placed under the categories folder. They can contain content
of their own, and can use templates in the same way that content files can.

In addition to this, an entry for the category should be made in the categories.yml file. This entry
should be on a new line, and be in the form "{Category Name}:", with no indentation.

Adding a page to a category
---------------------------

To add pages to a category, edit the categories.yml file. Find the heading for the category you wish
to add the page to and add a line for the page name, indented by at least one space. If it is a
category you are adding to another, include a "!" before the category name.

Example
-------

In the example below, the category "Foo" includes the content page "Bar" and also the category
"Bar", and the category "Bar" includes the category "Baz".

Foo:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!Bar

Bar:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!Baz
