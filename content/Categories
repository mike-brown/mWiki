Categories
==========

Categories are used to group similar pages together. Categories can belong to other categories,
giving a hierachical structure. Categories can also have their own content, such as shown on the
[Categories][1] category page.

Categories are used in two ways: to add a page of content or a sub-category into a category, and
to control the content of the category itself.

Adding a page to a category
---------------------------

To add a given page into a category, you need to add a line to the content document for each
category that the page is a member of. This line is in the form of:

!!CODE
*category:{Name}*
!!ENDCODE

where {Name} is the name of the category to add the page to. There should be nothing but this
definition on the line

The link can appear at any point in the document, but are generally grouped. However, this also
means that templates can be used to add pages to categories automatically.
