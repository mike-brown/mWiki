Infobox
=======

Infoboxes allow for the summerisation of data into a small table, which will display in a consistant
fashion.

Definition
----------

Infoboxes are defined between regions, starting with the token INFO and continuing until an ENDINFO
token is reached. Both of these tokens should be on a line of its own.

Between the INFO/ENDINFO tokens are lines that map keys to values. Each of the lines is in the form
|<key>=<value>, where the key is any text delimited by the | symbol and the = symbol, and the value
is delimited by the = symbol and the line end.

As seen in the example on this page, links are processed in the usual manner.
