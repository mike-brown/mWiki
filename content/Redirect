Page Redirect
=============

To have a page redirect to another (for the purposes of article aliases), you can use the REDIRECT
keyword.

Usage
-----

The file to redirect from must contain a single line of the instruction to redirect, in the form:

REDIRECT: #**page_name**

where **page_name** is the name of the page to redirect to.
